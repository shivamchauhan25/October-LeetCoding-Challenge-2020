Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.

 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 2000
-106 <= nums[i] <= 106

SOlution:
Python:
class Solution(object):
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums):
        N = len(nums)
        if N <= 1: return N
        lengths = [0] * N #lengths[i] = longest ending in nums[i]
        counts = [1] * N #count[i] = number of longest ending in nums[i]

        for j, num in enumerate(nums):
            for i in xrange(j):
                if nums[i] < nums[j]:
                    if lengths[i] >= lengths[j]:
                        lengths[j] = 1 + lengths[i]
                        counts[j] = counts[i]
                    elif lengths[i] + 1 == lengths[j]:
                        counts[j] += counts[i]

        longest = max(lengths)
        return sum(c for i, c in enumerate(counts) if lengths[i] == longest)
